# Camera-Pose-Estimation
# ENPM673 â€“ Perception for Autonomous Robots

# Project 2

## A. File Structure

This projects consists of the following code files
+ Problem #1:
    1. Problem1.py
+ Problem #2:
    1. Problem2.py

## B. Modification to the given dataset/video/image:
- None

## C. Dependancies

+ Ensure the following depenancies are installed
    ```
    pip install numpy
    pip install scipy
    pip install matplotlib
    pip install opencv-python
    ```

+ Ensure that the above programs are downloaded into the same folder containing 
'project2.avi'

## D. Running the Program

+ Problem1:
+ Run the program "Problem1.py" to check the outputs.
+ As the program gets executed, the video, with detected lines and corners, can be seen.
+ The program will run for 1-2 mins, after which the camera pose estimation plots, number of lines plots are displayed.
+ The file - "HomographY_check", also gets generated. This is a text file to cross-check the generated matrix.
+ ---------
+ Problem2:
+ Run the program "Problem2.py" to check the outputs.
+ The panoramic image stiching given four images will be displayed.

## E. Results
+ On running each of the proframs, the output either pops out a plot or a video in individual window. The outputs can be correlated with the outputs shown in the report.
